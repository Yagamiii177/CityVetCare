# Expo runtime env (loaded by Expo CLI)
#
# Optional override:
# - If you're on a physical device and auto-detection fails (or you're using Expo Tunnel),
#   uncomment and set this to your PC's LAN IP.
# - Android Emulator typically works without this (uses 10.0.2.2).
#
# Example (this PC):
# EXPO_PUBLIC_API_URL=http://192.168.110.132:3000/api
